**Key takeaway:**  
This project analyzes Lebanon’s currency collapse through a macroeconomic lens, linking political institutions, fiscal imbalances, capital flows, and monetary policy failures to hyperinflation, capital controls, and long-run economic contraction.

## Project Overview

This project examines Lebanon’s 2019–2023 currency collapse by tracing its roots to long-standing institutional weaknesses, political fragmentation, and unsustainable fiscal and monetary practices.

Rather than focusing only on headline inflation figures, the analysis emphasizes **structural causes**:
- Sectarian governance and policy paralysis
- Chronic fiscal deficits financed through foreign borrowing
- A long-standing currency peg maintained through capital inflows
- Sudden collapse in investor confidence and capital flight

The collapse is analyzed using core macroeconomic frameworks taught in intermediate macroeconomics, with emphasis on real-world policy relevance.

## Analytical Framework

### Political Economy Foundations
- Post-independence governance structured along religious lines
- Power allocations based on an outdated population census
- Long-run reform paralysis due to consensus-based decision rules
- Post-civil war reconstruction financed primarily through debt

### Capital Flows & Balance of Payments
- Persistent current account deficits driven by imports
- Capital inflows used to sustain a fixed exchange rate
- Collapse in investment following loss of confidence
- Bank-imposed capital controls accelerating financial panic

### Aggregate Demand & Aggregate Supply
- **Short-run:**  
  Simultaneous leftward shifts in AD and AS following collapse of capital inflows and currency peg
- **Outcomes:**  
  Output contraction with rising prices (stagflation)
- **Long-run:**  
  Reduced capital stock, infrastructure failure, and labor outflows (“brain drain”) lowering potential GDP

## Key Insights

- Currency pegs can mask structural weaknesses but magnify collapse severity
- Sustained capital inflows are not a substitute for fiscal reform
- Political institutions critically constrain macroeconomic adjustment
- Capital controls, while stabilizing in theory, worsened confidence in practice

---

## Limitations

- Official post-collapse data quality is limited
- Informal exchange markets complicate precise measurement
- Analysis prioritizes structural interpretation over precise estimation
