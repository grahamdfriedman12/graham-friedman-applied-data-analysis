# Applied Data Analysis & Econometrics

This repository contains selected applied data analysis and econometrics projects using real-world datasets. The focus is on **model selection, interpretability, and analytical judgment**, with an emphasis on translating quantitative results into **clear, decision-relevant insights** rather than purely academic exposition.

## Featured Projects
Additional projects will be added as analyses are completed.

- **Used Car Pricing & Model Selection**  
  Applied regression, regularization, GAMs, and tree-based methods to model used vehicle prices. Emphasizes interpretability vs. predictive performance tradeoffs and produces inventory and pricing recommendations.  
  → **View project:** [`auto-dealership-pricing`](./auto-dealership-pricing)

- **Baltimore Ravens Football and Crime in Baltimore City**  
  Applied econometrics study analyzing post-game crime patterns using three-day windows following Ravens games (2011–2023). Focuses on count data modeling, inference, and policy-relevant interpretation rather than prediction.  
  → **View project:** [`ravens-crime-study`](./ravens-crime-study)

- **NBA Salary Determinants (2022–23)**  
  Econometric study using Stata log-salary regressions to test how performance (BPM), availability (games played), age, and awards (All-Star/All-NBA) relate to NBA pay in a regulated contract environment. Emphasizes robust inference and institutional interpretation.  
  → **View project:** [`nba-salary-determinants`](./nba-salary-determinants)
  
- **Baltimore Ravens & Local Economic Activity (2020–2024)**  
  Daily spending analysis testing whether Ravens home games and post-game windows shift aggregate citywide consumption. Uses Opportunity Insights city-daily spending data merged with Ravens game indicators; results align with sports economics literature showing weak/undetectable macro spending effects.  
→ **View project:** [`ravens-local-economic-activity`](./ravens-local-economic-activity)

## Project Focus Areas
These areas reflect the primary analytical domains explored across current and upcoming projects in this repository.
- Pricing and demand analysis
- Sports and behavioral economics

Each project folder includes a short overview, methodology summary, key findings, and supporting code or documentation where appropriate.

> Note: Projects are presented to emphasize analytical judgment and interpretability rather than purely academic exposition.
