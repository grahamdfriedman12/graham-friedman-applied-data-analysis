# Applied Data Analysis & Econometrics

This repository contains selected applied data analysis and econometrics projects using real-world datasets. The focus is on **model selection, interpretability, and analytical judgment**, with an emphasis on translating quantitative results into **clear, decision-relevant insights** rather than purely academic exposition.

## Featured Projects
Additional projects will be added as analyses are completed.

- **Used Car Pricing & Model Selection**  
  Applied regression, regularization, GAMs, and tree-based methods to model used vehicle prices. Emphasizes interpretability vs. predictive performance tradeoffs and produces inventory and pricing recommendations.  
  → **View project:** [`auto-dealership-pricing`](./auto-dealership-pricing)

- **Baltimore Ravens Football and Crime in Baltimore City**  
  Applied econometrics study analyzing post-game crime patterns using three-day windows following Ravens games (2011–2023). Focuses on count data modeling, inference, and policy-relevant interpretation rather than prediction.
